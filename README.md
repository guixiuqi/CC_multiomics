# A Proteogenomic Analysis of Cervical Cancer Reveals Therapeutic and Biological Insights

We performed a comprehensive proteogenomic profiling of cervical cancer (CC) tumors from 139 Chinese patients. Integrated proteogenomic analysis linked genetic aberrations to downstream pathogenesis-related pathways and revealed the landscape of HPV-associated multi-omic changes. EP300 was found to enhance the acetylation of FOSL2-K222, consequently accelerating the malignant proliferation of CC. Proteomic stratification identified three patient subgroups with distinct features in prognosis, genetic alterations, immune infiltration and post-translational modification regulations. PRKCB was further identified as a potential radioresponse-related biomarker of CC patients. This study provides a valuable public resource for researchers and clinicians to delve deeper into molecular causes of CC, and to identify potential treatments and advance clinical practice.
